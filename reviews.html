            <h3>Nurse with Wound - Homotopy to Marie</h3>

            <p>One of the most absurd and dark albums I've ever heard! The sound collages create an atmosphere of oppression and aggression. The constant but unexpected jumpscares add to this dark soundscape. A complex album that requires full attention and patience, but repays!</p>

            <h3>Maurizio Bianchi - Symphony for a Genocide</h3>

            <p>the first half is underwhelming. I didn't find this project that interesting. the album cover is abysmal, representing one of the saddest phenomenon in human history, but the music itself is quite uninteresting. Maybe the repetitiveness of it all represents the state of abandon and fear in the camps, but it could have been called "the forest at night" and it would have been the same.

Belzec is actually terrifying, the distorted sounds make for a scary and disorienting atmosphere

The continuous hammering sound reminds me of what would happen if you get used to destruction during war, with rifles and bombs detonating at every moment

Each track on the LP was named after a Nazi Extermination Camp. The cover featured photographs of the Auschwitz Orchestra, a group of concentration camp prisoners who were forced to play classical music as people were herded into the gas chambers. The back cover included the text "The moral of this work: the past punishment is the inevitable blindness of the present"</p>
